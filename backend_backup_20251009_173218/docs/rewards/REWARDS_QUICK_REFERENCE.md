# üéÆ Milestone Rewards System - Quick Reference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Same-Day Logging Requirement

**Points are only awarded for same-day logging.** Users can backfill data for past dates, but points are only earned when logging on the current day. This reinforces the habit of immediate tracking without streak-based pressure.

## üí∞ How Users Earn Points

| Action | Base Points | Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Daily Login | 100 | N/A | Once per day |
| Log Food | 50 | Food milestone level | Scales with experience |
| Log Weight | 150 | Weight milestone level | Scales with experience |
| First Food Log | 500 | N/A | One-time |
| First Weight Log | 500 | N/A | One-time |
| Early Bird Breakfast | 100 | N/A | Before 10am |
| Complete Day (3 meals) | 250 | N/A | Breakfast, lunch, dinner |
