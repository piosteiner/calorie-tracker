# User-Contributed Foods & Pios Food DB Growth System

## üìñ Overview

This system enables **organic growth** of "Pios Food DB" by capturing user-contributed foods and providing admin tools to review and promote quality contributions to the official database.

---

## üéØ Key Concepts

### **1. Food Sources**
Foods are categorized by source:
- **`system`**: Official Pios Food DB foods (verified)
- **`custom`**: User-created foods (pending review)
- **`imported`**: Foods from external APIs

### **2. Verification Status**
- **`is_verified = 0`**: User-contributed, pending review
- **`is_verified = 1`**: Official Pios Food DB entry

### **3. Visibility**
- **`is_public = 1`**: Visible to all users
- **`is_public = 0`**: Private to creator only

## üé® User Experience

### **For Regular Users**
When creating a food:
```json
POST /api/foods
{
  "name": "My Homemade Smoothie",
  "caloriesPerUnit": 180,
  "defaultUnit": "100g"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "foodId": 145,
  "contributedToDatabase": true
}
```

The user sees they contributed to the database!

### **For Admins**
1. **View Dashboard**: See all user contributions
2. **Sort by Popularity**: Find foods worth adding
3. **Edit & Promote**: Clean up data and add to Pios Food DB
4. **Track Contributors**: See which users contribute quality foods

---

## üîÑ Migration Path

### **Existing Foods**
The migration automatically:
- Sets `source='system'` and `is_verified=1` for admin-created foods
- Keeps `source='custom'` and `is_verified=0` for user foods
- Adds tracking fields without disrupting existing data

### **Future Foods**
All new user-created foods are automatically tracked with:
- `created_by`: User ID
- `source='custom'`
- `is_verified=0`
- `is_public=1` (visible to all by default)

## üìà Growth Strategy

### **Phase 1: Organic Collection**
Users naturally create foods they can't find ‚Üí Database grows organically

### **Phase 2: Quality Promotion**
Admin regularly reviews popular user foods ‚Üí Promotes quality ones

### **Phase 3: Reduced Overhead**
As Pios Food DB grows ‚Üí Users find more foods ‚Üí Less manual entry needed

**Result:** Self-sustaining, community-driven food database! üéâ

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Quality

### **Quality Indicators**
- **Usage Count**: Foods logged multiple times are likely accurate
- **Unique Users**: Multiple users using same food = high confidence
- **Creator History**: Track which users contribute quality data

### **Admin Tools**
- **Edit Before Promote**: Fix typos, standardize names
- **Add Notes**: Document why food was promoted/rejected
- **Delete Unused**: Remove low-quality contributions

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these KPIs:
1. **User Contribution Rate**: How many users create foods
2. **Promotion Rate**: % of user foods promoted to Pios DB
3. **Database Growth**: Pios Food DB size over time
4. **Manual Entry Reduction**: Fewer new user foods over time

**Implementation Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**

**Goal**: Grow Pios Food DB from ~150 foods to 1000+ through community contributions! üöÄ
