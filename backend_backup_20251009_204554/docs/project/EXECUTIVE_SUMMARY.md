## ✅ What Was Done

### **Critical Improvements Implemented (7 items)**

1. **✅ Created `.gitignore` file**
   - Prevents sensitive data from being committed
   - Excludes node_modules, logs, .env files
   - Industry-standard protection

2. **✅ Environment variable validation**
   - New file: `config/env.js`
   - Validates required variables on startup
   - Server fails fast with clear error messages

3. **✅ Removed hardcoded secret fallbacks**
   - No more `process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'default-value'`
   - Forces proper configuration
   - Enhanced security

4. **✅ Enhanced health check endpoint**
   - Tests database connection
   - Returns HTTP 503 if unhealthy
   - Includes version and environment info

5. **✅ Database connection validation**
   - Tests connection before starting server
   - Prevents broken state
   - Professional startup sequence

6. **✅ Graceful shutdown handler**
   - Closes connections properly
   - Responds to SIGTERM/SIGINT
   - Clean process exit

7. **✅ Stricter auth rate limiting**
   - Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes (was 100)
   - Better protection against brute force
   - General API: Still 100 requests/15min

## 📈 Before vs After

### **Startup Sequence**

#### Before ❌
```
1. Load dependencies
2. Start HTTP server
3. Hope database works
```

#### After ✅
```
1. Load dependencies
2. Load & validate environment
3. Test database connection
4. Start HTTP server
5. Register shutdown handlers
6. Log success with details
```

### **Error Handling**

#### Before ❌
```
Missing JWT_SECRET → Uses 'your-secret-key'
Database down → Server starts anyway
SIGTERM signal → Abrupt shutdown
```

#### After ✅
```
Missing JWT_SECRET → Server won't start
Database down → Server won't start
SIGTERM signal → Graceful cleanup
```
