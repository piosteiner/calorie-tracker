# 🎉 User-Contributed Foods System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. Database Enhancement**
- **New Fields Added to `foods` Table:**
  - `is_public`: Controls visibility (public vs private)
  - `verified_by`: Tracks which admin verified the food
  - `verified_at`: Timestamp of verification
  - `contribution_notes`: Admin notes about the contribution
  - `usage_count`: Tracks how many times food has been logged

- **Automatic Tracking:**
  - User-created foods are now automatically tracked with `created_by` field
  - Foods are marked as `source='custom'` and `is_verified=0` by default
  - Admin-created foods are `source='system'` and `is_verified=1`

- **Database Views:**
  - `user_contributed_foods`: View all pending user contributions with stats
  - `pios_food_db`: View all official verified foods

### **2. Backend API Endpoints**

#### **User Contributions Management:**
```
GET  /api/admin/user-foods
     - List user-contributed foods with usage statistics
     - Sortable by popularity, recency, or alphabetically
     - Filterable by minimum usage count

GET  /api/admin/user-foods/stats
     - Get overall contribution statistics
     - Shows top contributors
     - Popular foods metrics

POST /api/admin/user-foods/:id/promote
     - Promote user food to official Pios Food DB
     - Edit food data before promotion
     - Add admin notes

POST /api/admin/user-foods/:id/reject
     - Reject a food contribution with reason

DELETE /api/admin/user-foods/:id
       - Delete unused user food

GET  /api/admin/pios-food-db
     - View all official verified foods
     - Searchable and paginated
```

### **3. User Experience Enhancement**
- When users create foods via `POST /api/foods`, they now receive:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "foodId": 142,
    "contributedToDatabase": true  // ← New field
  }
  ```
- Users know they're contributing to the community database!

### **4. Workflow Implementation**

```

       ↓
[Custom Food]
(source='custom', is_verified=0)
       ↓
Food Gets Used by Multiple Users
       ↓
